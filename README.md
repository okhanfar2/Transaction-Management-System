Transaction-Management-System-SQL:
Our database schema consists of three databases that record personal details, branch details, and city information, respectively. The database is built using SQL, and we have implemented PL/SQL for the transaction system, where the user is prompted to enter an account number and select a transaction option. Based on the user's input, the appropriate transaction is executed, and the user's current balance is updated and displayed. We used TOAD for Oracle to develop and run this project, leveraging its features for writing, testing, and managing PL/SQL scripts efficiently.
